# HONOR MagicBook fan control on Linux (FRI-H76 / FRI-HXX)

Custom fan control — including **full zero-RPM (fan completely stopped)** — for the
**HONOR MagicBook X 14 Pro 锐龙版 2023** on Linux (Debian / Ubuntu).

- **Product**: 荣耀 MagicBook X 14 Pro 锐龙版 2023, 集显, R7 16GB+512GB
- **Model**: **FRI-H76** (FRI-HXX series, SKU C233)
- **SoC**: AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS + Radeon 780M (integrated)
- **BIOS**: Insyde (locked — no fan option in setup)

On this machine Linux exposes **no** `hwmon`/`pwm`/`thermal` interface for the fan,
there is no fan option in the BIOS, and `nbfc` has no profile for it. The only way
to control the fan is to talk to the **Embedded Controller (EC)** directly. This repo
does exactly that, safely and reversibly.

> **TL;DR** — two EC registers control the fan:
> `0x0A19` = enable/mode, `0x0A18` = speed (**safe range 0–10 only**, see below).
> Writing both to `0` stops the fan. The EC keeps trying to spin it back up, so a
> 0.5-second re-assert loop holds it stopped while the CPU is cool, and hands it
> back to automatic control above a temperature threshold — with a hysteresis gap
> so it doesn't chatter right at that boundary.

## ⚠️ Read this first

- **Only confirmed on the HONOR FRI-H76.** Other HONOR models likely use the same
  scheme but **different register offsets** — run `scripts/correlate.sh` to find
  yours before writing anything. **Do not blindly reuse these offsets on another model.**
- Writing the EC is **reversible**: EC RAM is volatile, so a **reboot restores
  everything**. This does **not** touch the BIOS/firmware flash.
- **Never write** the region **`0x0A70`–`0x0A8F`** — on this machine it holds the
  **battery vendor / serial strings**, not fan data. The fan registers are all in
  the low `0x0A00`–`0x0A19` range and do not overlap it.
- Holding the fan off raises the idle equilibrium temperature. The provided loop has
  a **temperature threshold** that releases the fan back to automatic control when
  the CPU heats up. Keep it enabled. Use at your own risk.

## How it works

The DSDT exposes two EC accessor methods under `\_SB.PCI0.LPC0.EC0`:

- `RDER(offset16)` → read one byte from extended EC space
- `WTER(offset16, value)` → write one byte to extended EC space

(These reach the `0x0Axx` extended offsets; the generic `ec_sys` module cannot.)
We call them from userspace via the **`acpi_call`** kernel module (`/proc/acpi/call`).

### The registers (measured on FRI-H76)

| Offset | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0A00` / `0x0A01` | Fan0 RPM readback (hi/lo). `RPM = (0x0A00<<8) \| 0x0A01` | reads real RPM |
| `0x0A04` | RPM ÷ 100 readback | 25 ↔ 2500 RPM |
| **`0x0A18`** | **Fan speed / duty target — safe range 0–10 only** | see calibration table below |
| **`0x0A19`** | **Fan enable / mode**: `0`→disabled, `1`→enabled (obeys `0x0A18`) | `0`+`0x0A18=0`→**stops (0 RPM)** |
| `0x0A08`,`0x0A0A`,`0x0A0B` | current-state readback (writes get overwritten) | not control inputs |
| `0x0A70`–`0x0A8F` | ⚠️ **battery vendor/serial strings — never write** | not fan-related |

**Stop the fan:** `WTER(0x0A19,0)` then `WTER(0x0A18,0)`.
**Back to automatic:** `WTER(0x0A19,1)` then `WTER(0x0A18,3)` (or just reboot).

#### Calibration table (`0x0A18`, with `0x0A19=1`, idle ~41 °C)

| `0x0A18` | RPM |
|---|---|
| 0 | 0 (stopped) |
| 1 | ~1763 |
| 2 | ~1989 |
| 3 | ~2216 |
| 5 | ~2796 |
| 8 | ~3477 |
| 10 | ~3970 |

`0x0A18` is monotonic and stable across **0–10**. Values at or above **16 do not give
a higher steady speed** — they trigger the EC's own reset/ramp-restart behaviour
instead (confirmed unstable at 16, 32, 128, and 255: the register briefly holds the
written value, then the EC silently overwrites it back down and re-climbs through its
own low-speed states on its own, with zero further writes from us). **Never command
`0x0A18` outside 0–10.** Separately, stress-testing all cores under the EC's own
factory automatic control peaked at **~3993 RPM at 100 °C** — essentially identical to
our measured `0x0A18=10`, confirming 10 is the hardware's real ceiling, not an
artificial cap.

### Why a loop is needed

The EC runs its own temperature→fan curve in the background and slowly **servos the
registers back** to its own targets — this holds regardless of what value you write,
including out-of-range ones (see above), so there is no "sticky" value that the EC
simply leaves alone. A single write only stops the fan for a few seconds. Re-asserting
`0`/`0` every 0.5 s holds it stopped. That is what `fan-hold.sh` / the systemd service
do — and they hand control back to the EC above a temperature threshold, releasing it
again only once the CPU has cooled a further margin below that threshold (hysteresis),
so the fan doesn't chatter on and off right at the boundary.

### Verified result

At idle, holding `0x0A19=0 / 0x0A18=0` kept **Fan0 at 0 RPM for 37 of 40 s**, with the
CPU rising only **43 → 45 °C** (Tjmax is **100 °C** — the CPU throttles to sit there
safely under heavy load, by design). Releasing restored automatic control and the fan
spun back up normally.

## Install

### 1. Get `acpi_call` working (once)

```bash
sudo bash scripts/setup-acpi-call.sh
```

This installs `acpi-call-dkms`. **If Secure Boot is enabled** it also generates a MOK
signing key, signs the module, and enrolls the key — then you **reboot once**, choose
**Enroll MOK** on the blue screen, and enter the one-time password you set. After that:

```bash
sudo modprobe acpi_call
ls /proc/acpi/call        # should exist
```

### 2. Try it live (no install)

```bash
sudo bash scripts/read-ec.sh          # show fan RPM + registers
sudo bash scripts/fan-stop.sh         # stop the fan once
sudo bash scripts/fan-auto.sh         # give it back to automatic control
sudo bash scripts/fan-hold.sh         # hold off < 65°C, auto >= 65°C, resumes holding only below 55°C
sudo bash scripts/fan-hold.sh 60 5    # custom: auto at 60°C, resumes holding below 55°C
```

`fan-hold.sh [ON_C] [HYST_C]` — Ctrl-C releases to auto immediately.

### 3. Optional: run it at boot (systemd)

```bash
sudo install -m 755 scripts/fan-hold.sh /usr/local/bin/honor-fan-hold
sudo install -m 644 systemd/honor-fan.service /etc/systemd/system/honor-fan.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now honor-fan.service
# edit the "65 10" args in the service file's ExecStart to change the thresholds
```

Stop/undo:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now honor-fan.service   # ExecStopPost returns fan to auto
```

## Scripts

| Script | What it does | Writes EC? |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/setup-acpi-call.sh` | install + (if needed) sign & enroll `acpi_call` | no |
| `scripts/read-ec.sh` | print fan RPM and key registers | no |
| `scripts/correlate.sh` | idle/load/cooldown scan to **find** the fan registers | no |
| `scripts/watch-rpm.sh [SECS]` | read-only RPM+temp monitor, tracks peak (EC auto stays in charge) | no |
| `scripts/stress-peak.sh [SECS] [ABORT_C]` | load all cores, read-only, to measure the factory max fan speed | no |
| `scripts/probe-value.sh REG VAL [SECS] [CEIL_C]` | hold one (register,value) and re-assert it every second, printing RPM — confirms a *steady-state* value vs. a transient | yes |
| `scripts/probe-sticky.sh REG VAL [SECS] [CEIL_C]` | write a value **once**, then only read — reveals whether the EC drifts it away on its own (used to rule out "sticky" special values) | yes |
| `scripts/fan-stop.sh` | stop the fan once | yes |
| `scripts/fan-auto.sh` | return the fan to automatic control | yes |
| `scripts/fan-hold.sh [ON_C] [HYST_C]` | temperature-safe loop, holds the fan stopped with a hysteresis band | yes |
| `scripts/calibrate-curve.sh` | early sweep script; superseded by `probe-value.sh`/`probe-sticky.sh` (its rapid-sweep sampling produced misleading transients) — kept for reference only | yes |
| `scripts/fan-curve.sh` | experimental multi-step temperature→duty curve (smoother ramp than the on/off model above); not the recommended/installed script, kept as a documented alternative | yes |

## Adapting to another HONOR model

Run `sudo bash scripts/correlate.sh` and read the output table. The register whose
value tracks RPM under load (and is *not* one of your `hwmon` temperatures) is your
RPM readback; the enable/duty pair are usually right next to it. Confirm with small,
reversible up-writes (drive the fan *faster* first — that's always safe at idle)
before trying to slow or stop it.
